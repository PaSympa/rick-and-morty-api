Clean RmZpi + MVI is an Android application that uses the **Rick and Morty API** to demonstrate how to implement the **Model-View-Intent (MVI)** architecture in a Kotlin Android app. It showcases the usage of modern libraries and tools, including:
- **Jetpack Compose** for declarative UI
- **Ktor** for networking
- **Koin** for dependency injection
- **Clean Architecture** principles

This app serves as a practical guide for developers looking to adopt MVI architecture, clean code practices, and modern tools in their Android applications.
